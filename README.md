# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
[I was out sick when we reviewed the submission process, so I was unsure whether I should fill this section out. Therefore, I added some comments below, but realize that some of these are really meant for the final submission!].

 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

 As I have begun working on this project (and using this as a submission for my draft codebase), I'm noticing that I need to work a bit more on how I want to structure this game. Right now, everything is in the game class, and I'm relying pretty heavily on my main() function to facilitate user choices. I realized this when I was working on my architecture diagram, and saw that most of the "relationships" I was making in my code were of methods, but not classes (if I understand these two things correctly!). Additionally, I'm not sure I'm able to terminate the game once the player has made a "wrong" choice, which is something I need to figure out. 

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project? Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?

 So far, one thing I've had to figure out (and more remind myself of) is java syntax, and being able to fully employ different classes to achieve different things. As I've mentioend above, I'm pretty heavily relying on one class right now, which I believe is limiting my ability to create a full program. 

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

 (Knowing that this reflection is for the final project, I wanted to write about the things I'm planning to implement to give more context to the Architecture Diagram). In order to complete this game, I'm planning to have the user grab different items after answering riddles/trivia on Smith (seeyleItem, hubbardItem, etc.). They then have to correctly use each item with the appropraite ghost to be able to set it free (where there will be some indication of what the "right" item is). This is where the methods for freeBassGhost(), freeHillyerGhost() will come in. This will also force the player to explore more parts of the campus! 

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

 Since I was out sick last week, I didn't get as much of a chance to recieve feedback on my broad assignment pitch/begining code. However, I'm planning to attend Prof Crouser's office hours this Friday to get some feedback!  

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
